Learning front end web dev in 147 days


## Why front end web development?
I have enjoyed all things computer related since I can remember. After serving in the Army I decided to use my G.I. Bill towards a degree in software engineering. While I really do enjoy traditional software development, I think that front end web development is a better fit for me. The thought of developing everything that the user interacts with is quite exciting indeed!

### Okay, but why 147 days?
As noted above, I have used my G.I. Bill towards a degree in software engineering. I graduate in June 2017 with a B.S. in IT. My graduation date is roughly 147 days away from today so it just seemed like a fitting timescale. It also has three digits that occur in pi, just out of order. I \<3 pi.

### What kinds of projects will be here?
I plan to start with a homepage for this learning path. After that my days will be mixed between coming up with new project ideas that I link form the home page or improvements on the home page itself. My goal is to have a production quality site that contains links to smaller more entertaining projects by the time I complete this project. The homepage can then be added to my portfolio when it comes time to apply for jobs.

## License
Everything here is free to download, use and share. Feel free to do whatever you want with it!

## Contributions
While most of the projects here are not generally geared towards others, contributions are always welcome. I am new to Github as well as not being very experienced (yet!) in web development. I encourage anyone that wants to participate to do so. I know I could use the help and it would be great fun along the way.

##### Disclaimer
I don't really know much about GitHub just yet. If I end up forking a branch that should of been commited to the merged headless master, then I am sorry! Hopefully in time my GitHub knowledge will improve.
